# Indie Studio Epitech

**Indie Studio** is a remake of the **Bomberman** game. The goal of the game is to kill the opponents by droppping bombs. You can pick up power-ups to upgrade either the number of bomb you can drop, your bomb ray range or your moving speed. It's possible to play locally with 3 other players or against IA if you are not 4 players.
